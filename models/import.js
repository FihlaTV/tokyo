After being made, each piece is stamped with the seal of Evisu approval, a hand painted seagull logo. The production of every product is labor intensive and the equipment is rare so the prices of the jeans are often expensive.\n\nEvisu offers several different styles to fit a consumers needs ranging from women's, men's, and a newly added children's line.

Fiberops have collaborated with major brands and designers including Nike, Michael Lau and New Balance. Their fashion line includes premium denim jeans, jackets, shirts, hats, shoes, skateboard decks, accessories and other items.\n\nRaised in Brooklyn, his professional career spanning from San Diego to Hong Kong, Alyasha Owerka-Moore's varied geographical background is as diverse as his ethnic make-up and cultural intersts. It should be no surprise, then, that this postmodern Rennaissance man has been responsible for some of the most trend-setting and intriguing work in contemporary fashion history. From his past successes within the skate / urban / street universe, cultivating iconic brands like Shut Skates, Alphanumeric, Dub Brand outerwear, Droors, American Dream Inc. Skates, and now his current label, Fiberops, Aly has not only been there and done that, chances are that he's the one who founded it.\n\nWith Fiberops, Alyasha rejects the current belt-printed, melon-colored and trust-funded t-shirt hype that defines modern streetwear, opting instead for a more subtle and sophisticated approach to quality cut and sew garments with a classic appeal. Aly's iconoclastic perspectives on street fashion establish him as a true pioneer, and as such, Altamont is honored to present his contributions to our Fall 2008 collection through this limited collaboration",

   "Description": "Takeo Kikuchi is well known as a Japanese designer in both industry and fashion. His work includes the acclaimed Takeo Kikuchi clothing line as well as a wide array of eyewear frames and time pieces. Kikuchi’s role in the design of his clothing brand ended in 2004 when he stepped down from his role of head designer, handing over the reins to Taishi Nobukuni. Nobukuni has since gone on to start his own label but the time spent at the head of Takeo Kikuchi introduced a vintage/contemporary cross over style that rejuvenated the label both commercially and critically.\nTakeo Kikuchi’s most famous line has been its menswear collection, developed after Kikuchi left his previous role as the lead designer of Mens Bigi, a highly popular men’s label in Japan. After it had been publicly pursued by World Co, a large apparel company in Kobe, Japan, the Takeo Kikuchi brand of menswear took off and became widely recognized as a top brand in Japan, quickly spreading its influence to Korea and China. The success was largely attributed to the uniquely Asian style of the cuts that combined the luxury of European styles and brands with the sensibility and fit of the domestic brands. After Taishi Nobukuni took over the creative lead at Takeo Kikuchi, the design changed to reflect the current streetwear culture in Japan, bringing in a sense of retro style that was previously unseen in the otherwise conservative label’s designs.",
